Hello! 
I'm Pleuni Sangers, and I'm curious to learn a lot more about data analytics. 
I recently completed a course from WINC Academy (see repository WINC for all the assignments).
Now I want to learn even more by following this Data Science path: https://github.com/ossu/data-science. I've already taken the following courses: What is Data Science? Data Science Tools and Data Science Methodology
I really enjoy analyzing data, and I want to switch my career to data analytics.
